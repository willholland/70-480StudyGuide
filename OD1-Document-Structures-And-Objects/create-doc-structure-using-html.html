            <section id="introduction">
                <p>
                    In this article, we'll be covering the first skill covered under the first objective domain <span
                        class="italic bold">Implement and Manipulate Document Structures and Objects</span>: Create the
                    document structure by using HTML.
                </p>
                <p>According to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-480.aspx#syllabus-1" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>,
                    the skills measured are as follows:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    Structure the UI by using semantic markup, including markup for search engines and screen readers,
                    such as Section, Article, Nav, Header, Footer, and Aside; create a layout container in HTML
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    This page has been built using all of the specifically mentioned elements, as well as some other
                    new elements introduced in HTML 5. Information regarding each elements will be
                    included in it's own section, and I'll try to do my best to explain when and why to use each
                    element.
                </p>
                <p>An important thing to keep in mind is that, though I have styled these pages, these new elements are
                    meant to convey the structure of the document and not the appearance of the content.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="sectionElement">
                <h1>The Section Element</h1>
                <p>The <span class='italic bold'>&lt;section&gt;</span> element, according to W3, represents "a generic
                    section of a document or application. A section, in this context, is a thematic grouping of
                    content, typically with a heading."</p>
                <p>Common comparisons include chapters in a book or a home page being split into an introduction, news,
                    and contact information.</p>
                <p>
                    The first question I asked myself was <span class="italic">"How is this different than a 'div'
                        tag?"</span> After all, "a generic section of a documnet" sounds like a div to me. The major
                    difference is that the section element
                    is meant to group content that are contextually related.
                </p>
                <p>As an example, each element on this place is logically grouped together into it's own section.
                    Everything in this "Section Element" section, and all of it's contents, belong to one section
                    element. The "Article" section belongs to anotther</p>
                <p>So, when do you use a div or span? Basically, when you're wanting to call out a specific piece or
                    group of content for styling purposes only. All of the italicized text was styled via a class on a
                    &lt;span&gt; tag.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="articleElement">
                <h1>The Article Element</h1>
                <p>From the W3C Specification, the article element is defined as follow:</p>
                <blockquote>The article element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site and that is, in principle, independently distributable or reusable, e.g. in syndication. This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.</blockquote>
                <p>A bit of a mouthful, I believe the short version is that an article is any part of your document that is still coherent when everything else is taken away from your page.</p>
                <p>The classic comparison would be to a new papers column, or an article from a magazine. You can clip out a particular story (or comic) from the news paper and the same information is still conveyed.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="articlesAndSections">
                <h1>Articles and Sections</h1>
                <p>So, here's an interesting situation. An &lt;article&gt; tag can contain any number of &lt;section&gt; tags. Additionally, &lt;section&gt; tags can contain any number of &lt;article&gt; tags. And both elements can contain other instances of the same element. Having sections within sections makes lexical sense. Articles within articles less so, at least for me...but you can certainly do it.</p>
                <p>So, should this page be a "Skills Measured" section with an article for each skill, or is it a single article with a section for each skill?</p>
                <p>I focused on my intent that the contents on this page were meant to be kept together as one big article. While some sections could certainly stand on their own merit, others (such as this section) cannot.</p>
                <p>I think the specifications for these elements, and that fact that each can contain the other, suggests that there's more than one "right" way...which makes perfect sense. Sections of news papers consist of articles, and each article in a newspaper can contain multiple sections (like an introduction, body, and summary).</p>
            </section>
            <section id="navElement">
                <h1>The Nav Element</h1>
                <p>Again, the description from W3</p>
                <blockquote>The nav element represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page: a section with navigation links.</blockquote>
                <p>Simple enough, right? This element is just used to denote a group of links used for navigational purposes.</p>
                <p>There are, however, situations where you should not use the &lt;nav&gt; element to group a list of links. If you have a list of links, such as references or "More like this" links, those should not be grouped by the nav element.</p>
                <p>Any "global" navigation links, such as those at the top of this page, or links used to help navigate the structure of the current document like the ones on the left column, should be contained within the nav element.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="headerElement">
                <h1>The Header Element</h1>
                <p>I think this is probably one of the most self explanatory elements in all of HTML. Nevertheless, here's the W3 Schools summary of the element</p>
                <blockquote>The &lt;header&gt; element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.</blockquote>
                <p>The header tag should be used as frequently as it makes sense. Each article or section should probably contain a header. Likewise your site itself may have a "main" heading, like the one at the top of this page.</p>
                <p>In addition to the "masthead" heading at the top featuring my mugshot and "global" navigational elements, the left navigation contains a header element ("Table of Contents").</p>
                <p>There are some suggestions that the header can be overused and should only be used when you have more than just a single h1..h6 element.<sup>[3]</sup> As a developer, less code seemed good, so none of my section headers are contained within a header tag.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="footerElement">
                <h1>The Footer Element</h1>
                <p>The only element probably more self explantory than header would be footer. Here's what W3 Schools says about it.</p>
                <blockquote>The &lt;footer&gt; tag defines a footer for a document or section</blockquote>
                <p>Basically, including informational or navigational elements for the content the footer is contained within</p>
                <p>This page has two examples of a footer element.</p>
                <p>First is the "Details" section at the bottom of this content area. This section contains links to the sources I referenced in this document.</p>
                <p>The second example is the footer at the very bottom of the page. Right now, it has some pseudo-legal footer sounding stuff, but it would be common to see information about the site author (name, email, etc..), links back to the top of the page, and/or copyright information. </p>
            </section>
            <section id="asideElement">
                <div>
                    <h1>The Aside Element</h1>
                    <p>The &lt;aside&gt; element is a new semantic element used to suggest that the content contained within is somewhat related to the current topic, but not necessarily a part of the content. Confusing, I know. </p>
                    <p>Here's how the folks at W3 put it.</p>
                    <blockquote>The &lt;aside&gt; element represents a section of a page that consists of content that is tangentially related to the content around the aside element, and which could be considered separate from that content.</blockquote>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>Think of an aside like that moment in a conversation where you're recounting the events of a car trip, and when you get to the part where <span class="italic">Stairway to Heaven</span> came on the radio, you make some commentary about how much you love Led Zepplin...that commentary is an aside.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>Or, for perhaps a less personal example, if you've ever read a magazine article and seen those englarged excerpted quotes (called "pull quotes")...that's another form of an aside. See the aside just above here for a live one!</p>
                </div>
                <aside class="pullquote">"Asides can be styled to do some neat stuff" - Me</aside>
            </section>
            <section id="detailsElement">
                <h1>The Details Element</h1>
                <p>This is a neat little addition to HTML. As per usual, here's the W3 details</p>   
                <blockquote>The details element represents a disclosure widget from which the user can obtain additional information or controls.</blockquote>
                <p>What the details element actually does is create a collapsed section of content that the user can choose to expand to reveal more details. See below.</p>
                <details>
                    <p>Here are the details you requested</p>
                </details>
            </section>
            <section id="summaryElement">
                <h1>The Summary Element</h1>
                <p>I heavily considered placing this element in with the details element, 
                    because it's meant to only be used as the first child of a &lt;details&gt; element, but decided that it warrented it's own section 
                    due to the just to point that out.</p>
                <blockquote>The summary element represents a summary, caption, or legend for the rest of the contents of the summary element's parent details element.</blockquote>
                <p>When you use a summary tag witin a details tag, it replaces the default "Details" text (as seen in the previous section's example) with whatever text you supply as the contents of the summary tag.
                    for a specific example, please look at the "Referenced Sources" details element at the bottom of this page.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section id="summary">
                <h1>Summary</h1>
                <p>While this list doesn't include all of the latest additions to the HTML specifications, it covers the ones I've seen repeatedly mentioned in regards to preparing for 70-480</p>
                <p>Otheres, such as &lt;svg&gt;, will be covered in a different section</p>
