                <h1>Add & Modify HTML elements</h1>
                <p>If you're reading this, I'm going to assume that you're atleast familiar with Javascript, and I'm going to skip
                    a lot of the "JS 101" talk. Instead, I'm just going to dive into a demo. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This demo is going to allow you to click a few buttons. One will add an element to the page, the other will remove them. 
                    Both will update the "log" section. I'll include the code snippets below.  
                </p>
                <div id="section1DemoContainer">
                    <div class="canvas"></div>
                    <div class="log"></div>
                    <div class="buttonRow">
                        <button id="addElement">Add Element</button>
                        <button id="removeElement">Remove Element</button>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Here's the code that makes this example work.</p>
                <div class="codewrapper">
<pre><code class="prettyprint lang-js">(function(){
    var btnAdd = document.getElementById("addElement");
    var btnRemove = document.getElementById("removeElement");
    var canvas = document.getElementById("section1DemoContainer").childNodes[1];
    var log = document.getElementById("section1DemoContainer").childNodes[3];

    function SetLog(msg){
        var today = new Date();
        var time = today.getHours() + ":" + today.getMinutes() + ":" + today.getSeconds();
        log.innerHTML = time + " - " + msg;
    }

    btnAdd.addEventListener("click", function(){
        //Add a new div element to the canvas
        var newDiv = document.createElement("div");
        canvas.appendChild(newDiv);

        //Update the log
        SetLog("Added a new element");
    });

    btnRemove.addEventListener("click", function(){
        if(canvas.hasChildNodes() && canvas.lastChild.tagName === "DIV"){
            canvas.lastChild.remove();
            SetLog("Removed the last element");
        }
        else{
            SetLog("No elements to remove!")
        }
    });
})();</code></pre>
                </div>
                <p>
                    There's a little bit going on here, but I think the highlights relevant to the topic at hand are retrieving DOM elements, 
                    adding new elements, changing the contents of an element, and removing elements. 
                </p>
                <p>There's also some stuff happening with event handling, but that'll be covered later.</p>
                <section id="section1-getting">
                    <h2>Getting DOM Elements</h2>
                    <p>
                        Obviously, before we can manipulate an element of the DOM, we must first find it. In this code
                        sample, we're selecting elements in one of three ways. </p>
                    <p>
                        First, there's <code class="prettyprint">document.getElementById(...);</code>, which
                        allows us to select a single element by it's ID property. It's important to note that the getElementById
                        function
                        will only return a single DOM node, as you shouldn't have more than one element with the same ID.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next, there's <code class="prettyprint">document.getElementById(...).childNodes[1];</code>. The childNodes
                        property
                        is a 0-index based array containing all child nodes within the element from which the property hangs off of. In
                        the case of the sample above <code>childNodes[1]</code> selects the div element that has a class of "canvas",
                        and
                        <code>childNodes[3]</code> selects the div with a class of "log".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You might be wondering why these two elements are at index 1 and 3, instead of 0 and 1. Apparently, despite the
                        fact that
                        the DOM doesn't render white space, it does recognize that it's there. In the case of this page, I hit "enter"
                        after every tag,
                        which resulted in an invisible "text" node being added before every DOM element.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, there's the <code>canvas.lastChild</code> which, as the name suggests, returns the last child node of
                        the canvas element.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is also a <code>Node.firstChild</code> property but, due to the whole "text" node I mentioned earlier, it
                        doesn't typically lend itself to being useful.
                    </p>
                </section>
                <section id="section1-adding">
                    <h2>Adding elements to the DOM</h2>
                    <p>There are two important elements you need in order to add a new element to the DOM.</p>
                    <p>
                        First, you need an element to add. In the example above, we're creating a new "div" element
                        with <code>document.createElement("div");</code>. This returns a new Node object that we can 
                        use. If you had specific HTML or element attributes you wanted to add, you would then add them 
                        to this element.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And we need somewhere to put our new element, of course. In the demo, we're appending our element
                        to the canvas element with <code>canvas.appendChild(newDiv);</code>. This, along with some CSS, is what 
                        allows us to add a new rectangle to the canvas. 
                    </p>
                </section>
                <section id="section1-modifying">
                    <h2>Modifying DOM elements</h2>
                    <p>What a broad topic. The demo above modifies DOM elements in three ways.</p>
                    <p>First, adding new elements is technically modifying the canvas element, but we've already counted that.</p>
                    <p>Second, we're also removing elements with <code>canvas.lastChild.remove();</code> which is (again) modifying the canvas element.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we're also changing the text of the "log" div whenever one of the two buttons is pressed 
                        with <code>log.innerHTML = time + " - " + msg;</code>.</p>
                </section>
            </section>
            <section id="section2">
                <h1>Media Controls</h1>
                <p>For this section, we'll be discussing the new &lt;audio&gt; and the &lt;video&gt; elements and how they can be used to 
                    add some...well audio and video...to your page.
                </p>
                <section id="section2-Audio">
                    <h2>Audio</h2>
                    <div>                        
                        <audio controls loop preload="auto">
                            <source src="media/Onlap - Fight Like The Devil (Copyright Free Rock Music).mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
                            Your browser does not support the audio element.
                        </audio>
                        <div class="trackName">Fight Like The Devil - Onlap</div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Audio is added your page via the &lt;audio&gt; tag, like so...</p>
                    <div>
                        <pre><code class="prettyprint">&lt;audio controls autoplay loop preload="auto"&gt;
    &lt;source src="media/Onlap - Fight Like The Devil (Copyright Free Rock Music).mp3" type="audio/mpeg"&gt;
    &lt;source src="media/Onlap - Fight Like The Devil (Copyright Free Rock Music).ogg" type="audio/ogg"&gt;
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
&lt;/audio&gt;</code></pre>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The <code>controls</code> attribute is what allows the element to be rendered. Without it, the element exists but is not rendered, which could be useful
                        if you wanted to create custom controls and use javascript to control the audio track. Custom controls are beyond the scope of 70-480, so I'll not be 
                        covering them here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <code>autoplay</code> and <code>loop</code> attributes do exactly what you would think. I'll point out that while the above code sample indicates that
                        autoplay is enabled, the actual source for the rendered audio control does not. You're welcome.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <code>preload</code> attribute indicates when the browser should load the media. A value of "auto" indicates that the media should be loaded 
                        when the page loads, while a value of "none" would wait for the media to be played before loading it. Apparently browsers are not required to respect
                        the value, as it's seen as a request. I'm guessing that's to allow mobile devices to avoid consuming data unecessarily (think Facebook and their autoplay videos).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> specifies the file to play. If you have multiple version of the file, just in different formats (mp3, ogg, etc) you can add
                        multiple source items, one after the other. The browser will play the first file whose format it can understand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, after listing all of your audio files, you can add some text that would be displayed if none of the source files are supported by the browser.
                    </p>
                </section>
                <section id="section2-Video">
                    <h2>Video</h2>
                    <p>Adding video to your HTML page is easier than ever. Take the following example...</p>
                    <div>
<pre><code class="prettyprint">&lt;video width="50%" controls poster="media/ManusFatherOfTheAbyss.jpg"&gt;
    &lt;source src="media/video.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
&lt;video&gt;</code></pre>                        
                    </div>
                    <p>...which produces the result below</p>
                    <video controls poster="media/ManusFatherOfTheAbyss.jpg">
                        <source src="media/video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                        Your browser does not support the video tag.
                    </video>
                    <p>
                        As is the case with the audio element, the <code>controls</code> attribute is what allows the user to interact with the video. However, unlike the audio element 
                        failing to display the controls will result in the video thumbnail being displayed. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As for the thumbnail itself, the <code>poster</code> is an optional attribute allows you to specify an image to display until the video is started. If you 
                        do not include a poster attribute, the first frame of the video will be used as the image.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are a few other attributes that can be placed on the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element, such as <code>autoplay</code>, <code>loop</code>, and <code>muted</code>
                        ...all of  which do what they suggeset. The <code>preload</code> attribute is also valid here and, like audio, can be ignored by the browser.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The source attribute, and the fallback text, work precisely as they do with the audio element so I won't rehash that here.

                    <p>
                        Think of the canvas element as a replacement for flash applications. It provides a way to "draw" 2D images on your page and, when combined with 
                        javascript, can be used to create animations. As far as I understand, though, being able to animate a canvas object is not a measured skill, so 
                        I'll not be touching on that particular subject.

                        the use of the canvas element, and provides some nifty examples beyond what I'll include here.
                    </p>
                    <p>So, let's get to a demo.</p>
                    <canvas id="canvas-demo"></canvas>
                    <p>To create this effect, two parts are required: the HTML and Javascript. We'll look at the HTML first</p>
                    <pre><code class="prettyprint">&lt;canvas id="canvas-demo"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;</code></pre>                    
                    <p>
                        That's all there is to it, at least on the HTML side. You could also specify the width and height property here
                        but I prefer to leave that in my CSS. But where are all of those squares coming from, you might be wondering. 
                        That's where javascript comes into play.
                    </p>
                    <div>
<pre><code class="prettyprint lang-js">(function(){
    var canvas = document.getElementById("canvas-demo");
    var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
        
    ctx.fillStyle = "rgba(255,0,0,.5)"
    ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 75, 75)
    
    ctx.fillStyle = "rgba(0,255,0,.5)"
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.arc(70, 70, 40, 0, 2 * Math.PI)
    ctx.fill();
        
    ctx.fillStyle = "rgba(0,0,255,.5)"
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.moveTo(90, 60);
    ctx.lineTo(30,130);
    ctx.lineTo(150,130);
    ctx.fill();    
})();</code></pre>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        With the first two lines, we're first retrieving the canvas element we're wanting to draw on. 
                        After that, we're establishing a 2d "drawing context". There are other kinds of contexts (3d isn't one of them), but '2d' is
                        all I've seen mentioned in the context of 70-480.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The remaining lines of code are used to draw the three shapes you see. You'll notice that each set starts with the line <code class="prettyprint">ctx.fillStyle = "rgba(255,0,0,.5)"</code>
                        which is just specifying the red, green, blue, and alpha (opacity) used to fill in the shape. 
                    </p>
                    <p>The <code class="prettyprint">ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 75, 75)</code> creates a 75x75 rectangle, whose top corner starts 10pixels down and 10 to the right.</p>
                    <p>
                        The next two shapes both start with <code>ctx.beginPath()</code>, which says we're going to begin drawing, and end with <code>ctx.fill()</code> which says that we're done drawing, go ahead and render everything.
                        What I personally find interesting is that their is no fillArc method, but I digress.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the circle, we're using the <code>ctx.arc(x, y, r, angleStart, angleEnd)</code>. 
                        The x and y parameters indicate where the center of the circle will be positioned.
                        The r parameter is the radius (how many pixels from the center to the edge). 
                        The last two parameters, angleStart and angleEnd, indicate the angle at which to start and stop 
                        drawing. What's important to note is that these values are in radians (and not degrees). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The final shape, a triangle, we're starting our drawing at the point (90, 60) with <code>ctx.moveTo(90,60)</code>
                        then drawing a line from (90,60) to (30, 130) with <code>ctx.lineTo(30,130)</code>, and then another
                        from (30,130) to (150, 130) with <code>ctx.lineTo(150,130)</code>. You may notice that we've only drawn
                        two lines. That's because the <code>ctx.fill()</code> function will connect the dots on our behalf.

                    <h2>SVG Graphics</h2>
                    <p>
                        SVG elements are, in my opinion, a little more straight forward than the canvas element as they don't 
                        require any javascript to render. Take the following example that I've shamelessly lifted from w3schools.
                    </p>
                    <div>
<pre><code class="prettyprint">&lt;svg width="300" height="200"&gt;
    &lt;polygon points="100,10 40,198 190,78 10,78 160,198" style="fill:#4580BA;stroke:black;stroke-width:5;fill-rule:evenodd;" /&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;
</code></pre>
                    </div>
                    <svg width="300" height="200">
                        <polygon points="100,10 40,198 190,78 10,78 160,198" style="fill:#4580BA;stroke:black;stroke-width:5;fill-rule:evenodd;" />
                    </svg>
                    <p>
                        Similar to how we drew the triangle in the canvas demo, the <code>points</code> attribute specifies a series of points, connected by lines. 
                        The style attribute dictates how to color things.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And, of course, there's a "rect" element as well as an ellipse and circle (thankfully) element. Check out 
                        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_svg.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_svg.asp</a> for more
                        examples and some details on comparing SVG to the Canvas element.
